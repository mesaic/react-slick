# react-slick

The purpose of this fork is to
- slim down API surface,
- reduce technical debt / complexity of the original project,
- convert code to more recent ES2015/next style
- rearchitect code to make it more unit-testable
- use Travis && Code Coverage && semantic-release

It doesn't support bower anymore, arrow / dots elements are not provided.

**This is a work in progress and not really ready for general production use.**

### Installation
```bash
  npm install react-slick
```

### Example
```js
var React = require('react');
var Slider = require('react-slick');

var SimpleSlider = React.createClass({
  render: function () {
    var settings = {
      dots: true,
      infinite: true,
      speed: 500,
      slidesToShow: 1,
      slidesToScroll: 1
    };
    return (
      <Slider {...settings}>
        <div><h3>1</h3></div>
        <div><h3>2</h3></div>
        <div><h3>3</h3></div>
        <div><h3>4</h3></div>
        <div><h3>5</h3></div>
        <div><h3>6</h3></div>
      </Slider>
    );
  }
});
```
